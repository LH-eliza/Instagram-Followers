Who Doesn't Follow You Back on IG and Who Hasn't Accepted Your Follower Request on IG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learn who doesn't follow you back on Instagram to ensure no bots are trying to get your follow and then unfollowing you. 
You can also see who hasn't accepted your follower request too, using JSON files through your own Instagram account. 

Who Doesn't Follow You Back: 

1. To make it easier- login to Instagram using search engine- and download your data by going to Privacy and Security and scroll down to Data Download and tap Request download (it will take around 10 minutes for Instagram to send you the data) make sure it's downloaded as a JSON file (it won't run if it's an HTML file).

2. Download the folder that Instagram emailed to you and open the folder, then click on the followers_and_following and find the file called followers.json and following.json. 

3. Make a new folder and copy those to files mentioned above into the new folder. Once you have this folder prepared open a code editor or IDE, create a new file inside this folder called main.py, and copy the code provided into the file. 

4. Once you have everything setup, run the main.py.

**If you have any issues, contact me!** I'll try to make another version using JS later


(it isn't complete yet ;-;)
